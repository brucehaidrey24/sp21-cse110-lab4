1. The bug is happening because num1 and num2 have data types that are strings rather than numbers.

2. To fix this, I use the parseInt method within the calculateSum function for the parameters being passed, and then set result to be equal to the sum of my new variables. My screenshots for questions 1 and 2 are in my directory titled screenshots.
